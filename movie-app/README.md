Goals
●	Set up a React front-end application from scratch
●	Interact with a Movie API to load and interact with data
●	Deploy and share the experience
The Challenge 🎬
Created an app that allows users to search for movies by title, bookmark them, and leave reviews for future reference.
Requirements:
●	Used React and Tailwind CSS, and deployed the app on Vercel. Accomplished all of this for free using Vercel's Hobby plan.
●	The app should:
o	Allow movie searches by title.
o	Display paginated search results.
o	Bookmark movies.
o	Review bookmarked movies.
o	Mark bookmarked movies as "watched."
●	To search for movies, used the free RapidAPI movies endpoint. 
●	Used local storage for bookmarking (there is no need for a database, authentication, or user accounts for this task).
